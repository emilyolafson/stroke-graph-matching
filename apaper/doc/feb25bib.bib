  abstract = "The brain is an endocrine organ, sensitive to the rhythmic
              changes in sex hormone production that occurs in most mammalian
              species. In rodents and nonhuman primates, estrogen and
              progesterone's impact on the brain is evident across a range of
              spatiotemporal scales. Yet, the influence of sex hormones on the
              functional architecture of the human brain is largely unknown. In
              this dense-sampling, deep phenotyping study, we examine the
              extent to which endogenous fluctuations in sex hormones alter
              intrinsic brain networks at rest in a woman who underwent brain
              imaging and venipuncture for 30 consecutive days. Standardized
              regression analyses illustrate estrogen and progesterone's
              widespread associations with functional connectivity. Time-lagged
              analyses examined the temporal directionality of these
              relationships and suggest that cortical network dynamics
              (particularly in the Default Mode and Dorsal Attention Networks,
              whose hubs are densely populated with estrogen receptors) are
              preceded-and perhaps driven-by hormonal fluctuations. A similar
              pattern of associations was observed in a follow-up study one
              year later. Together, these results reveal the rhythmic nature in
              which brain networks reorganize across the human menstrual cycle.
              Neuroimaging studies that densely sample the individual
              connectome have begun to transform our understanding of the
              brain's functional organization. As these results indicate,
              taking endocrine factors into account is critical for fully
              understanding the intrinsic dynamics of the human brain.",

              parcellation approach to define nodes for network analysis. The
              application of network-theory-based analysis to extend the
              utility of functional MRI has recently received increased
              attention. Such analyses require first and foremost a reasonable
              definition of a set of nodes as input to the network analysis. To
              date many applications have used existing atlases based on
              cytoarchitecture, task-based fMRI activations, or anatomic
              delineations. A potential pitfall in using such atlases is that
              the mean timecourse of a node may not represent any of the
              constituent timecourses if different functional areas are
              included within a single node. The proposed approach involves a
              groupwise optimization that ensures functional homogeneity within
              each subunit and that these definitions are consistent at the
              group level. Parcellation reproducibility of each subunit is
              computed across multiple groups of healthy volunteers and is
              demonstrated to be high. Issues related to the selection of
              appropriate number of nodes in the brain are considered. Within

              within and between large-scale functional brain networks over
              time has yet to be characterized. Here, we applied dynamic
              community detection techniques to data from a highly sampled
              female with 30 consecutive days of brain imaging and venipuncture
              measurements to characterize changes in resting-state community

              subcortical, and attention networks exhibited higher than
              expected levels of nodal flexibility, a hallmark of
              between-network integration and transient functional
              reorganization. The most striking reorganization occurred in a
              default mode subnetwork localized to regions of the prefrontal
              cortex, coincident with peaks in serum levels of estradiol,
              luteinizing hormone, and follicle stimulating hormone. Nodes from
              these regions exhibited strong intra-network increases in

              suggests that ovulation results in a temporary, localized
              patterns of brain network reorganization. Author Summary Sex
              steroid hormones influence the central nervous system across
              multiple spatiotemporal scales. Estrogen and progesterone
              concentrations rise and fall throughout the menstrual cycle, but
              it remains poorly understood how day-to-day fluctuations in
              hormones shape human brain dynamics. Here, we assessed the
              structure and stability of resting-state brain network activity
              in concordance with serum hormone levels from a female who
              underwent fMRI and venipuncture for 30 consecutive days. Our
              results reveal that while network structure is largely stable
              over the menstrual cycle, there is temporary reorganization of
              several largescale functional brain networks during the ovulatory
              window. In particular, a default mode subnetwork exhibits
              increased connectivity with itself and with regions from
              temporoparietal and limbic networks, providing novel perspective
              into brain-hormone interactions. \#\#\# Competing Interest

              neural resources rather than stroke-induced neural

              brain enable the flexible adaption to varying motor demands
              compared to healthy subjects. Accordingly, eleven well-recovered
              left-hemispheric chronic stroke patients were scanned using

              assessed for fist closures at increasing movement frequencies
              performed with the affected/right or unaffected/left hand. In

              which leads to impairments of functional brain networks involved
              in voluntary movements. In some cases, the brain has the
              intrinsic capacity to reorganize itself, thereby compensating for
              the disruption of motor networks. In humans, such reorganization
              can be investigated in vivo using neuroimaging. Recent
              developments in connectivity analyses based on functional
              neuroimaging data have provided new insights into the network
              pathophysiology underlying neurological symptoms. Here we review
              recent neuroimaging studies using functional resting-state
              correlations, effective connectivity models or graph theoretical
              analyses to investigate changes in neural motor networks and
              recovery after stroke. The data demonstrate that network
              disturbances after stroke occur not only in the vicinity of the
              lesion but also between remote cortical areas in the affected and
              unaffected hemisphere. The reorganization of motor networks
              encompasses a restoration of interhemispheric functional
              coherence in the resting state, particularly between the primary
              motor cortices. Furthermore, reorganized neural networks feature
              strong excitatory interactions between fronto-parietal areas and
              primary motor cortex in the affected hemisphere, suggesting that
              greater top-down control over primary motor areas facilitates
              motor execution in the lesioned brain. In addition, there is
              evidence that motor recovery is accompanied by a more random
              network topology with reduced local information processing. In
              conclusion, Stroke induces changes in functional and effective
              connectivity within and across hemispheres which relate to motor

              connectivity (rsFC) between homotopic, motor-related brain
              regions is associated with upper-extremity control early after
              stroke. OBJECTIVES: This study examined various patterns of rsFC
              in chronic stroke, a time at which extensive neural
              reorganization has occurred. Associations between homotopic
              somatomotor connectivity and clinical measures, representing
              separate domains of upper-extremity function, were determined.
              METHODS: A total of 19 persons $\geq$6 months poststroke
              participated. Four connectivity patterns within a somatomotor
              network were quantified using functional magnetic resonance
              imaging. Upper-extremity gross muscle activation, control, and
              real-world use were evaluated with the Motricity Index, Action
              Research Arm Test, and accelerometry, respectively. RESULTS:
              Connectivity between homotopic regions was stronger than that in
              the contralesional and ipsilesional hemispheres. No differences
              in connectivity strength were noted between homotopic pairs,
              indicating that a specific brain structure was not driving
              somatomotor network connectivity. Homotopic connectivity was
              significantly associated with both upper-extremity control (r =
              0.53; P= .02) and real-world use (r = 0.54; P= .02); however,
              there was no association with gross muscle activation (r = 0.23;
              P=.34). The combination of clinical measures accounted for 40\%
              of the variance in rsFC (= .05). CONCLUSIONS: The results
              reported here expand on previous findings, indicating that
              homotopic rsFC persists in chronic stroke and discriminates
              between varying levels of upper-extremity control and real-world

              dorsal attention network and an arm somatomotor network, and
              determined the correlation of FC with performance obtained in a
              separate session on tests of attention and motor function. In
              particular, we compared the behavioral correlation with
              intrahemispheric FC to the behavioral correlation with
              interhemispheric FC. RESULTS: In the attention network,
              disruption of interhemispheric FC was significantly correlated
              with abnormal detection of visual stimuli (Pearson r with field
              effect = -0.624, p = 0.002). In the somatomotor network,
              disruption of interhemispheric FC was significantly correlated
              with upper extremity impairment (Pearson r with contralesional

              intrahemispheric FC within the normal or damaged hemispheres was
              not correlated with performance in either network. Quantitative
              lesion analysis demonstrated that our results could not be

              behavioral output. Clinically, these results validate using FC
              for assessing the health of brain networks, with implications for

  author   = "Carrera, Emmanuel and Tononi, Giulio",
  abstract = "After a century of false hopes, recent studies have placed the
              concept of diaschisis at the centre of the understanding of brain
              function. Originally, the term 'diaschisis' was coined by von
              Monakow in 1914 to describe the neurophysiological changes that
              occur distant to a focal brain lesion. In the following decades,
              this concept triggered widespread clinical interest in an attempt
              to describe symptoms and signs that the lesion could not fully
              explain. However, the first imaging studies, in the late 1970s,
              only partially confirmed the clinical significance of diaschisis.
              Focal cortical areas of diaschisis (i.e. focal diaschisis)
              contributed to the clinical deficits after subcortical but only
              rarely after cortical lesions. For this reason, the concept of
              diaschisis progressively disappeared from the mainstream of
              research in clinical neurosciences. Recent evidence has
              unexpectedly revitalized the notion. The development of new
              imaging techniques allows a better understanding of the
              complexity of brain organization. It is now possible to reliably
              investigate a new type of diaschisis defined as the changes of
              structural and functional connectivity between brain areas
              distant to the lesion (i.e. connectional diaschisis). As opposed
              to focal diaschisis, connectional diaschisis, focusing on
              determined networks, seems to relate more consistently to the
              clinical findings. This is particularly true after stroke in the
              motor and attentional networks. Furthermore, normalization of
              remote connectivity changes in these networks relates to a better
              recovery. In the future, to investigate the clinical role of
              diaschisis, a systematic approach has to be considered. First,
              emerging imaging and electrophysiological techniques should be
              used to precisely map and selectively model brain lesions in
              human and animals studies. Second, the concept of diaschisis must
              be applied to determine the impact of a focal lesion on new
              representations of the complexity of brain organization. As an
              example, the evaluation of remote changes in the structure of the
              connectome has so far mainly been tested by modelization of focal

  abstract = "OBJECTIVE: The pathogenesis of isolated pontine infarctions is
              still unclear, being attributed both to small or large vessel
              disease. The extension of infarcted tissue to the pons surface
              has been indicated as a possible marker of basilar branch
              atheromatous disease and some neuroimaging evidence confirms this
              finding. METHODS: On the basis of Kim's et al., study, we
              performed a revision of the literature addressing this topic.
              RESULTS: Several authors confirm an association between basilar
              artery branch disease and isolated pontine infarction; moreover,
              the enlargement of pontine lesion seems to be associated with
              neurological worsening. We therefore performed a brief analysis
              of possible mechanisms of progression. CONCLUSIONS: Prospective

              mechanisms underlying this recovery of function remain unclear.
              METHODS: Twenty well-recovered patients with acute pontine
              infarcts and 20 well-recovered patients with acute
              striato-capsular infarcts were recruited. Fugl-Meyer assessment
              and resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging were
              performed 1, 4 and 12 weeks after onset. Patients were further
              assigned to better and worse recovery subgroups according to the
              degree of motor recovery at the twelfth week after stroke.
              Voxel-wise degree centrality (DC)-behavior correlation analysis
              was used to identify brain regions related to changes in motor
              function within 12 weeks after stroke. RESULTS: A significant
              correlation was found between DC and Fugl-Meyer scores within 12
              weeks in the ipsilesional cerebellar crus I and crus II in
              patients with pontine infarction and in the ipsilesional middle
              temporal gyrus in patients with striato-capsular infarction (all

              higher both in the better and worse recovery subgroups at the
              fourth than at the first week (all P < 0.05). In addition, the

              is a marker of good upper-limb behavior and recovery following
              stroke. However, there is less understanding of neural mechanisms
              that might help facilitate upper-limb motor recovery in stroke
              survivors with extensive CST damage. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of
              this study was to investigate resting state functional
              connectivity in chronic stroke survivors with different levels of
              CST damage and to explore neural correlates of greater upper-limb
              motor performance in stroke survivors with compromised
              ipsilesional CST integrity. METHODS: Thirty chronic stroke
              survivors (24 males, aged 64.7 $\pm$ 10.8 years) participated in
              this study. Three experimental sessions were conducted to: 1)
              obtain anatomical (T1, T2) structural (diffusion) and functional
              (resting state) MRI sequences, 2) determine CST integrity with
              transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) and conduct assessments
              of upper-limb behavior, and 3) reconfirm CST integrity status.
              Participants were divided into groups according to the extent of
              CST damage. Those in the extensive CST damage group did not show
              TMS evoked responses and had significantly lower ipsilesional
              fractional anisotropy. RESULTS: Of the 30 chronic stroke
              survivors, 12 were categorized as having extensive CST damage.
              Stroke survivors with extensive CST damage had weaker functional
              connectivity in the ipsilesional sensorimotor network and greater
              functional connectivity in the ipsilesional fronto-parietal
              network compared to those with preserved CST integrity. For
              participants with extensive CST damage, improved motor
              performance was associated with greater functional connectivity
              of the ipsilesional fronto-parietal network and higher fractional
              anisotropy of the ipsilesional rostral superior longitudinal
              fasciculus. CONCLUSIONS: Stroke survivors with extensive CST
              damage have greater resting state functional connectivity of an
              ipsilesional fronto-parietal network that appears to be a
              behaviorally relevant neural mechanism that improves upper-limb

              patients of varying severity when different measures are used and
              when different cut-off points are selected. 459 individuals
              enrolled in a prospective cohort study were assessed within 14
              days post stroke and re-evaluated at 1, 3, and 6 months. Recovery
              was assessed using the NIH Stroke Scale, the Fugl-Meyer
              Assessment of Motor Recovery, the Barthel Index of Activities of
              Daily Living, the Physical Function Index of the SF-36, and the
              Modified Rankin Outcome Scale. Subjects also defined their
              preference (utility) for their current health state with a
              time-trade off question. We compared patterns of recovery using
              the different measures and varying the cut-off points for
              defining successful recovery. The percentage of patients who are
              believed to have recovered depends on how recovery is defined. If
              recovery is defined at the disability level (Barthel > 90), the
              majority 57.3\% of stroke survivors experience a full recovery.
              Fewer individuals are considered to be fully recovered if
              impairments are measured (NIH 90, 36.8\%. Less than 25\% of
              stroke survivors are considered recovered if recovery is defined
              relative to reported prior function in higher levels of physical
              activity. Shifting the definition of recovery on the modified
              Rankin scale from </= 1 to </= 2 shifts the percentage of those
              deemed recovered from </= 25\% to 53.8\%. In designing drug
              trials the methods for defining stroke recovery should be
              carefully considered. If recovery is defined in terms of
              disability, a higher proportion of the placebo group will achieve
              the outcome than if impairments are used to define recovery. The
              benchmarks for recovery in minor strokes must include measures of
              higher functioning (e.g. the SF-36 physical functioning index or
              a Rankin 0 (no symptoms).",

              Twenty patients underwent three-dimensional pseudo-continuous

              First, we investigated CBF changes in the acute stage, and
              longitudinal changes from 1 week to 6 months after PI. Brain
              regions with longitudinal CBF changes were then used as seeds to
              investigate longitudinal FC alterations during the follow-up
              period. Compared with NC, patients in the left PI (LPI) and right
              PI (RPI) groups showed significant CBF alterations in the
              bilateral cerebellum and some supratentorial brain regions at the

              values in the right supramarginal (SMG\_R) for the LPI group,
              while the RPI group showed significantly dynamic changes of CBF

              changes in the SMG\_R and FC values between the SMG\_R and MOG\_L
              were associated with motor and memory scores in the LPI group,

              presented simultaneously with an ipsilesional stimulus (Corbetta
              and Shulman, 2011). Unilateral damage to the macaque
              frontoparietal cortex commonly leads to deficits in
              contralesional target selection that resemble visual extinction.
              Recently, we showed that macaque monkeys with unilateral lesions
              in the caudal prefrontal cortex (PFC) exhibited contralesional
              target selection deficits that recovered over 2-4 months (Adam et
              al., 2019). Here, we investigated the longitudinal changes in
              functional connectivity (FC) of the frontoparietal network after
              a small or large right caudal PFC lesion in four macaque monkeys.
              We collected ultra-high field resting-state fMRI at 7-T before
              the lesion and at weeks 1-16 post-lesion and compared the
              functional data with behavioural performance on a free-choice
              saccade task. We found that the pattern of frontoparietal network
              FC changes depended on lesion size, such that the recovery of
              contralesional extinction was associated with an initial increase
              in network FC that returned to baseline in the two small lesion
              monkeys, whereas FC continued to increase throughout recovery in
              the two monkeys with a larger lesion. We also found that the FC
              between contralesional dorsolateral PFC and ipsilesional parietal
              cortex correlated with behavioural recovery and that the
              contralesional dorsolateral PFC showed increasing degree
              centrality with the frontoparietal network. These findings
              suggest that both the contralesional and ipsilesional hemispheres
              play an important role in the recovery of function. Importantly,
              optimal compensation after large PFC lesions may require greater
              recruitment of distant and intact areas of the frontoparietal
              network, whereas recovery from smaller lesions was supported by a
              normalization of the functional network.",

              perilesional primary motor cortex (M1) of rhesus macaque monkeys
              are involved in the recovery of manual dexterity after a lesion
              of M1. A focal lesion of the hand digit area in M1 was made by
              means of ibotenic acid injection. This lesion initially caused
              flaccid paralysis in the contralateral hand but was followed by
              functional recovery of hand movements, including precision grip,
              during the course of daily postlesion motor training. Brain
              imaging of regional cerebral blood flow by means of H2
              (15)O-positron emission tomography revealed enhanced activity of
              the PMv during the early postrecovery period and increased
              functional connectivity within M1 during the late postrecovery
              period. The causal role of these areas in motor recovery was
              confirmed by means of pharmacological inactivation by muscimol
              during the different recovery periods. These findings indicate
              that, in both the remaining primary motor and premotor cortical
              areas, time-dependent plastic changes in neural activity and
              connectivity are involved in functional recovery from the motor
              deficit caused by the M1 lesion. Therefore, it is likely that the
              PMv, an area distant from the core of the lesion, plays an
              important role during the early postrecovery period, whereas the
              perilesional M1 contributes to functional recovery especially

  abstract = "We have hypothesized that most cases of aphasia or hemispatial
              neglect due to acute, subcortical infarct can be accounted for by
              concurrent cortical hypoperfusion. To test this hypothesis, we
              demonstrate: (i) that pure subcortical infarctions are associated
              with cortical hypoperfusion in subjects with aphasia/neglect;
              (ii) that reversal of cortical hypoperfusion is associated with
              resolution of the aphasia; and (iii) that aphasia/neglect
              strongly predicts cortical ischaemia and/or hypoperfusion. We
              prospectively evaluated a consecutive series of 115 patients who
              presented within 24 h of onset or progression of stroke symptoms,
              with MRI sequences including diffusion weighted imaging (DWI) and
              perfusion weighted imaging (PWI), and detailed testing for
              aphasia or hemispatial neglect. The association between aphasia
              or neglect and cortical infarct (or dense ischaemia) on DWI and
              cortical hypoperfusion indicated by PWI, was evaluated with
              chi-squared analyses. Fisher exact tests were used for analyses
              with small samples. Cases of DWI lesion restricted to subcortical
              white matter and/or grey matter structures (n = 44) were examined
              for the presence of aphasia or neglect, and for the presence of
              cortical hypoperfusion. In addition, subjects who received
              intervention to restore perfusion were evaluated with DWI, PWI,
              and cognitive tests before and after intervention. Finally, the
              positive predictive value of the cognitive deficits for
              identifying cortical abnormalities on DWI and PWI were calculated
              from all patients. Of the subjects with only subcortical lesions
              on DWI in this study (n = 44), all those who had aphasia or
              neglect showed concurrent cortical hypoperfusion. Among the
              patients who received intervention that successfully restored
              cortical perfusion, 100\% (six out of six) showed immediate
              resolution of aphasia. In the 115 patients, aphasia and neglect
              were much more strongly associated with cortical hypoperfusion
              (chi(2) = 57.3 for aphasia; chi(2) = 28.7 for neglect; d.f. = 1;
              P < 0.000001 for each), than with cortical infarct/ischaemia on
              DWI (chi(2) = 8.5 for aphasia; chi(2) = 9.7 for neglect; d.f. =
              1; P < 0.005 for each). Aphasia showed a much higher positive
              predictive value for cortical abnormality on PWI (95\%) than on
              DWI (62\%), as did neglect (100\% positive predictive value for
              PWI versus 74\% for DWI). From these data we conclude that
              aphasia and neglect due to acute subcortical stroke can be
              largely explained by cortical hypoperfusion.",

              the adult cortex, whether these same rules hold after
              stroke-induced damage is unclear. After stroke, sensory
              representations damaged by stroke remap onto nearby surviving
              neurons. Here, we review the process of sensory remapping after
              stroke at multiple levels ranging from the initial damage to
              synapses, to their rewiring and function in intact sensory
              circuits. We introduce a new approach using in vivo 2-photon
              calcium imaging to determine how the response properties of
              individual somatosensory cortex neurons are altered during
              remapping. One month after forelimb-area stroke, normally highly
              limb-selective neurons in surviving peri-infarct areas exhibit
              remarkable flexibility and begin to process sensory stimuli from
              multiple limbs as remapping proceeds. Two months after stroke,
              neurons within remapped regions develop a stronger response
              preference. Thus, remapping is initiated by surviving neurons
              adopting new roles in addition to their usual function. Later in
              recovery, these remapped forelimb-responsive neurons become more
              selective, but their new topographical representation may
              encroach on map territories of neurons that process sensory
              stimuli from other body parts. Neurons responding to multiple
              limbs may reflect a transitory phase in the progression from
              their involvement in one sensorimotor function to a new function

              alteration on a region- and network-wise level. In this way, WM

              quickly propagated to, and dissipated within, adjacent
              motor/hindlimb areas (<100 ms). One week after forelimb cortex
              stroke, the cortex was virtually unresponsive to tactile forelimb
              stimulation. After 8 weeks recovery, forelimb-evoked
              depolarizations reemerged with a characteristic pattern in which
              responses began within surviving portions of forelimb cortex (<20
              ms after stimulation) and then spread horizontally into
              neighboring peri-infarct motor/hindlimb areas in which

              first-time stroke patients with heterogeneous lesions at 1-2
              weeks post-stroke. We measured behavior over multiple domains and
              lesion anatomy with structural MRI and a probabilistic atlas of
              white matter pathways. Multivariate methods estimated the
              percentage of behavioral variance explained by structural damage.
              A few clusters of behavioral deficits spanning multiple functions
              explained neurological impairment. Stroke topography was
              predominantly subcortical, and disconnection of white matter
              tracts critically contributed to behavioral deficits and their
              correlation. The locus of damage explained more variance for
              motor and language than memory or attention deficits. Our
              findings highlight the need for better models of white matter
              damage on cognition.",

  abstract = "Numerous studies argue that cortical reorganization may
              contribute to the restoration of motor function following stroke.
              However, the evolution of changes during the post-stroke
              reorganization has been little studied. This study sought to
              identify dynamic changes in the functional organization,
              particularly topological characteristics, of the motor execution
              network during the stroke recovery process. Ten patients (nine
              male and one female) with subcortical infarctions were assessed
              by neurological examination and scanned with resting-state
              functional magnetic resonance imaging across five consecutive
              time points in a single year. The motor execution network of each
              subject was constructed using a functional connectivity matrix
              between 21 brain regions and subsequently analysed using graph
              theoretical approaches. Dynamic changes in topological
              configuration of the network during the process of recovery were
              evaluated by a mixed model. We found that the motor execution
              network gradually shifted towards a random mode during the
              recovery process, which suggests that a less optimized
              reorganization is involved in regaining function in the affected
              limbs. Significantly increased regional centralities within the
              network were observed in the ipsilesional primary motor area and
              contralesional cerebellum, whereas the ipsilesional cerebellum
              showed decreased regional centrality. Functional connectivity to
              these brain regions demonstrated consistent alterations over
              time. Notably, these measures correlated with different clinical
              variables, which provided support that the findings may reflect
              the adaptive reorganization of the motor execution network in
              stroke patients. In conclusion, the study expands our
              understanding of the spectrum of changes occurring in the brain
              after stroke and provides a new avenue for investigating
              lesion-induced network plasticity.",

              (fMRI) provides a useful but indirect approach to study the
              organization of human brain systems. An unresolved question is
              whether functional connectivity measured by resting-state fMRI
              reflects anatomical connections. In this study, we used the
              well-characterized anatomy of cerebrocerebellar circuits to
              directly test whether intrinsic functional connectivity is
              associated with an anatomic pathway. Eleven first-episode stroke
              patients were scanned five times during a period of 6 months, and
              11 healthy control subjects were scanned three times within 1
              month. In patients with right pontine strokes, the functional
              connectivity between the right motor cortex and the left
              cerebellum was selectively reduced. This connectivity pattern was
              reversed in patients with left pontine strokes. Although factors
              beyond anatomical connectivity contribute to fMRI measures of
              functional correlation, these results provide direct evidence
              that functional connectivity depends on intact connections within
              a specific polysynaptic pathway.",
