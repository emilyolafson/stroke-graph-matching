1. Extract precision matrices from timeseries data (set diagonals to 0 prior to graph matching)
2. Run graph matching algorithm on precision matrices
3. Calculate remapping frequencies
4. Perform analyses 

Optional: estimate structural disconnection using the [NeMo tool v2.0](https://kuceyeski-wcm-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/upload.html)
