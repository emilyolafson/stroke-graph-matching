cast-induced plasticity data. main folder: /cast_data/
- subject 1 has TR of 2.2s, subject 2 and 3 have TRs of 1.1s
- subject 2 and 3 were downsampled to have an effective TR of 2.2s.
- "short" timerseries were obtained to have ~14 mins of data (same as mean stroke pts.)
	- subject 1: 360 TRs, subject 2/3: 720 TRs, downsampled to 360.
- timeseries are all in /timeseries
- conn processing on colossus.
- subject 1: sub1
- subject 2 & 3: sub2_new, sub3_new

order to perform graph matching:
1. extract_covariance_cast.m --> covariance_short
2. extract_precision_matrices-cast.m --> precision_short/FCprec_concat_allsub.mat
3. unpack_precision_mats() --> precision_short/sub1, sub2, ...
4. merge_precision_mats_cast.m --> precision_short/C_precision.mat 
	- sets diagonal of precision matrices to 0 before grpah matching
5. graph_matching_precision_regularized_euclidean_cast.ipynb --> results

results/regularized:
- with euclidean distance regularization
